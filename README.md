# Inverse Pathways between Alzheimer’s and Cancer

**Team Members:** King Bello, Shubhan Chari, Sivant Dosaj, Neha Kaduskar, BJ Mensah, Sachit Sinah, Christine Wong

## Description:

The article “Cancer and Alzheimer's disease inverse relationship: an age-associated diverging derailment of shared pathways” published in 2021 by Lanni et. al. proposed an inverse relationship between cancer and Alzheimer's. Our team is interested in finding out if such an inverse relationship exists within our data. Cancer and Alzheimer’s are the leading cause of death in the US. We will be using different forms of data visualization to display Alzheimer's and cancer data per US state county. If we are able to use data to show that such an inverse relationship between cancer and Alzheimer’s exists, we may be able to create a predictive model for measuring cancer and Alzheimer rates based on counties and states.
