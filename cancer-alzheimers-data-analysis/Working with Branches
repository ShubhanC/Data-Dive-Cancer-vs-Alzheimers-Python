Before working in VSCode, make a new branch to work in
- In the VSCode terminal, type --> git branch ...(name)
- To see if we are in the branch, type --> git branch
    - This also shows all the branches that you have made
- To switch branch type --> git switch ...(name)

When you are in the branch that you have made, code what you want.

Once you are done with your work and want to push it back to the main branch you must merge to the main branch
- To merge the files type --> git merge -m "...(message)" ...(branch name)
- Then push the merge --> git push

To create an exact copy of you own branch type the following:
      git checkout -b new_branch old_branch

After you are done with the work in your branch and merged it to the main branch, delete the branch you made by typing:
      git branch -d ...(Branch Name)
